## Objective
To identify and remove potentially harmful browser extensions and understand browser security risks.

2. Reviewed installed extensions and their permissions.
3. Verified both installed extensions were from trusted sources.
4. No suspicious or unnecessary extensions were found.

## Extensions Reviewed

## Learnings
